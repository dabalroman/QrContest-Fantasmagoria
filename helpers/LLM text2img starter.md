The goal of this conversation is creating the square images from quotes from popculture. I'll provide quotes and you will thing what thing (like a hat, weapon, flower) can be easily connected to that quote, like a visual clue. We want to avoid IP problems, so we do not want to use characters themselves, but their attributes, parts of the stories are safe to use. We should first establish a common theme that all images should be in, to later produce visually similar images, like visual identification, continuity. I'm thinking of displaying the item on a colorful background, sort of dreamy style. Splashing colors and visible brush strokes. 
We will go for pictures with a full background.

Template for the prompt:
Portrait orientation, 4:3 ratio, watercolor painting of a single <OBJECT> centered in the frame at roughly 50% of the image height, rendered in a mid-realistic style with partly abstract brushstrokes. The Background is full-coverage abstract color splashes with soft edges and visible watercolor paper texture. Soft lighting, gentle contrast, no extra elements or text.

Each image have it's rarity value:
- Common - Gray background
- Rare - Blue background
- Epic - Purple background
- Legendary - Burst of colors including gold background
- Mythical - Royal red background
