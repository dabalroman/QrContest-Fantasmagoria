The goal of this conversation is creating the square images from quotes from popculture. I'll provide quotes and you will thing what thing (like a hat, weapon, flower) can be easily connected to that quote, like a visual clue. We want to avoid IP problems, so we do not want to use characters themselves, but their attributes, parts of the stories are safe to use. We should first estabilish a common theme that all images should be in, to later produce visually similar images, like visial identification, continuity. I'm thinging of displaying the item on colorful background, sort of dreamy style. Splashing colors and visible brush strokes. 

We will go for pictures with full background. 
The rarity pallete is clever idea, we will explore which colors to use as each rarity as background.
I think watercolor will be fine, but we need to create some example images from prompts to grasp the final look. I think we should go for the middleground between realism and abstraction. We will use DALL-E, in chatgpt, so no need for precise settings for stable diffusion.

Let's start with this quote:
"Niebieski kwiat i kolce, niebieski kwiat i kolce... Było by prościej, gdybym nie był daltonistą!"
I think the good object for that would be the blue flower, rose-like.

Use DALLE to create the image for me, provide variations so we can establish the visual style.

The style is very nice. The images should contain the object in the center, cause the image will be cropped into card format later. Create the image. If that's possible, we can use vertical, 3:4 ratio, so I don't need to crop that much. Only one object on whole image, centered, not as big.
